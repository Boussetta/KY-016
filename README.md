# KY-016 RGB 3-color LED module

KY-016 Arduino full color 5mm RGB LED, different colors can be obtained by mixing the three primary colors.

This module consists of a 5mm RGB LED and three 150Î© limiting resistors to prevent burnout. 
Adjusting the PWM signal on each color pin will result on different colors.
